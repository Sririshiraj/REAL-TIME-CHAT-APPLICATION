A Real-Time Chat Application is a software system that enables users to exchange messages instantaneously over the internet. The application ensures that messages are delivered to the intended recipient(s) as soon as they are sent, without delays. Real-time chat systems are often used for communication purposes, such as messaging between friends, customer support chats, or team collaboration.
The application establishes a WebSocket connection between the client (frontend) and the server (backend) using Socket.IO. This connection allows the server to instantly push new messages to all connected clients.
When a user sends a message, it is transmitted through the WebSocket to the server, which then broadcasts the message to all other connected users or to specific recipients in case of private messaging.
The frontend receives the message and updates the UI without needing to reload the page, allowing for smooth and instant communication.
TECHNOLOGY USED:
Frontend:
React for building an interactive, fast, and dynamic UI that responds to user input and real-time events.
HTML/CSS for structuring and styling the web pages.
Backend:
Node.js and Express for handling the backend server, making it easy to manage HTTP requests and real-time connections.
Socket.IO for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the client.
Real-Time Communication:
Socket.IO facilitates WebSocket connections that allow for low-latency, real-time message exchange between the server and clients.
